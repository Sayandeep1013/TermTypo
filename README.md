## Ranking System

ELO is tracked separately for each of the 7 modes.

| Tier | ELO Range |
|------|-----------|
| Bronze | 0 – 299 |
| Silver | 300 – 599 |
| Gold | 600 – 899 |
| Platinum | 900 – 1199 |
| Diamond | 1200 – 1499 |
| Master | 1500+ |

Each win/loss adjusts ELO by ±30. Floor is 0.

## Web App

A companion web interface is available for players who prefer the browser. It shares the same backend — accounts, ELO, match history, and leaderboards are all unified across terminal and web.

**Pages:**

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **solo** | Typing test with scrolling display and live keyboard visualization |
| **ranked** | Enter the matchmaking queue — cross-play with terminal clients |
| **rooms** | Create or join a private room by code |
| **leaderboard** | Top players per mode |
| **profile** | Personal best, per-mode ELO with progress bars, recent solo history |
| **download** | Links to the PyPI package and platform binaries |

Profile page shows your rank, ELO progress bar, wins/losses, and a recent solo results table (WPM, raw WPM, accuracy) for each mode. The ranked system is identical to the terminal — matches between terminal and browser clients count for ELO on both sides.

---

## Login

Login is completely optional — solo practice works without an account.

Ranked matches and private rooms require a Google account.  
On first login, your browser opens for Google OAuth. The app starts a temporary local server on `localhost:54321` to receive the callback — no credentials are stored anywhere except your local session file.

---

## Update

The app checks for updates on every launch and notifies you in the status bar.

```bash
pip install --upgrade termtypo
```
